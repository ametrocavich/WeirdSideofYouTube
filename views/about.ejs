      <h2>In Memory of Michael Metrocavich</h2>
    <div id='memorybody'>
    <!-- In honor of mike -->
      <p>Michael Metrocavich has recently passed away on February 23, 2017. He was the main contributor and inspiration for the undertaking of this open source project. Michael was a brilliant, kind and quirky person. He would always look for something interesting to happen or create interesting situations himself. Whether it was putting every single non-microwavable thing in the microwave or instigating a debate on a controversial topic, he always had fun. Michael will be missed by our team, his fraternity, and the entirety of the RCOS and RPI community.</p>
